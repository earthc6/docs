# Society

This page contains the IDL for a society canister. Each society canister is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) where you can share posts, proposals, vote and much more.

### Society Canister

- `addLedger`: adds the NFT to the society (add permission)
- `addPost`: share a post, returns the Post identifier UUID
- `createSociety`: create a new society and returns the identifier
- `createTag`: create a new tag
- `getAllPost`: get all posts as a collection
- `getAllSociety`: get all societies as a collection
- `getAllTags`: get all tags
- `getAllTagsDao`: get a collection of tuples of tags and array of Dao IDs
- `getLedgerByAccountID`: get NFT and collections for the provided wallet address
- `getLogs`: get debug logs
- `getPostByID`: get post entry by the UUID
- `getPostBySociety`: get all posts in the society
- `getSociety`: get society entry by the UUID
- `getSocietyByTag`: get societies that are in a tag
- `getTag`: return the tag entry
- `removeLedger`: remove the NFT from the society canister (remove permission)


## Examples

The below examples will require you to install and use the [Dfinity SDK](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/developers-guide/install-upgrade-remove.html). Please ensure that you have it installed as you will need `dfx` to run the commands below.

### Creating a new Tag
```
dfx canister call society createTag '(record {icon="/frontend/assets/Tags/all.png"; name="All"})'
```

The above creates a new tag called "All" with the icon URL.

### Creating a new Society

```
dfx canister call society createSociety 'record {name="Graffiti"; tag="Art"; background="/frontend/assets/Society/background/img_2.png"; icon="/frontend/assets/Society/icon/img_1.png"; description="Graffiti and street art"}'
```

The above creates a new society called "Graffiti" and associates it to the tag "Art". The method returns a UUID which is necessary for sharing posts, videos and images.

### Sharing a Text Post

```
dfx canister call society addPost '("Graffiti", record {ID="3"; post=variant {text=record {body="Now this is art"}}; author=record {coreUser=variant {address="bbefd96fef9f11b044cae5c4b797fd4f910eddbe8416b17ecee286f25531d6ff"}; name="EarthC6"; avatar="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dragonball/images/0/0d/DendeIllFightToo.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20110906232642"}})'
```

The above shares a post to the "Graffiti" society.
