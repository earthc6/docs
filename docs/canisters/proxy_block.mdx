# Proxy Block

This page contains the IDL for the proxy block canister. This is a proxy canister written in Rust that calls the public ledger.
You can test and use our canister on the [Internet Computer](https://ic.rocks/principal/fpvhp-kaaaa-aaaak-qabyq-cai).

### Proxy Block


- `block`: given a block height, validates the transaction and returns the block info data (including memo and transaction data)
- `tip_of_chain`: returns the latest block height of the block chain
